# FaceDetection-Using-LBPH-model-with-Simple-tkinterGUI
runs in jupyternotebook
first create date set with webcam by using create_date_Set file,it will be stored in images files with category(0,1,2 etc)
train model with training_model_image file and trainedmodel with yml extension will be created(update changes in code)
use Face_recog_GUI.ipynb file to open with GUI,can use detection in videoas as well
not a very accurate model as better fd algorithms are created already
